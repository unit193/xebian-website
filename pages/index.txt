== Welcome to Xebian! ==
The goal of this project is to make an Xfce Debian based system that is much like Xubuntu.

=== Features ===

 * Based on link://debian.org/[Debian] Unstable/sid. (link:https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/choosing.en.html[Is Unstable right for me?])
 * Uses Xfce as the desktop environment.
 * Modified default configuration, inspired by Xubuntu, to give you a traditional desktop look and feel.
 * With Greybird and Elementary Xfce icon theme from the link:http://shimmerproject.org/[Shimmer Project] for Xfce integration.

=== FAQ ===

*Q: Is this a derivative of Debian?*

Xebian most closely resembles a link:https://wiki.debian.org/DebianPureBlends[Debian blend], with only
a thin layer for artwork and configuration that differs from Debian.  No Xfce components "jump ahead"
in Xebian and all packaging work is done as part of the Xfce team.

*Q: What installer is used within Xebian?  Does it have a live desktop?*

Xebian comes as a live image, and while initially Xebian used debian-installer we've decided to follow
the Debian Live team in switching to Calamares.

*Q: I've locked myself out of the live session, what's the default password?*

link:https://live-team.pages.debian.net/live-manual/html/live-manual/customizing-run-time-behaviours.en.html[live-build]
sets the username and password, at the time of this writing the username is 'user' and password is 'live'.
