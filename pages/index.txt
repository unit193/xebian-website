 * Based on link://debian.org/[Debian] Unstable/sid.
 * With Xfce 4.12.
 * Modified default configuration to give you the best desktop experience without losing the classic look and feel.
 * Numix GTK+ theme by default, and other link:http://shimmerproject.org/[Shimmer Project] themes pre-installed.
