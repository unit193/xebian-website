== Welcome to Xebian! ==
The goal of this project is to make an Xfce Debian based system that is much like Xubuntu.

=== Features ===

 * Based on link://debian.org/[Debian] with both Jessie and Sid versions.
 * Xfce 4.12 for Debian Sid, and Xfce 4.10 for Jessie.
 * Modified default configuration to give you the best desktop experience without losing the classic look and feel.
 * Numix GTK+ theme by default, and other link:http://shimmerproject.org/[Shimmer Project] themes pre-installed.

=== Contact ===
